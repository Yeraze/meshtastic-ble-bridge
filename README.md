A Docker-based bridge that exposes a TCP api to Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Meshtastic devices. Designed for use with MeshMonitor, but works with any tool that supports the Meshtastic TCP interface.

**Features:**
- BLE-to-TCP protocol translation
- Automatic reconnection on node reboots or disconnects (v1.3+)
- Optional config caching for faster reconnections (v1.4.0+)
- Configurable cache size limits for memory management (v1.4.0+)
- mDNS/Avahi autodiscovery for zero-configuration networking
- Automatic service registration and cleanup
- Graceful shutdown with proper resource cleanup
- Comprehensive test suite with CI/CD

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker installed
- Bluetooth adapter (built-in or USB)
- Meshtastic device with BLE enabled

### 1. Build the Container
```bash
cd src
docker build -t meshmonitor-ble-bridge .
```

### 2. Find Your Device
```bash
docker run --rm --privileged --network host \
  -v /var/run/dbus:/var/run/dbus \
  meshmonitor-ble-bridge --scan
```

### 3. Pair Your Device (if required)
```bash
bluetoothctl
pair AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF  # Replace with your device MAC
trust AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF
exit
```

### 4. Start the Bridge
```bash
docker run -d --name ble-bridge \
  --privileged --network host \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -v /var/run/dbus:/var/run/dbus \
  -v /var/lib/bluetooth:/var/lib/bluetooth:ro \
  -v /etc/avahi/services:/etc/avahi/services \
  meshmonitor-ble-bridge AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF
```

The bridge will automatically register an mDNS service for network autodiscovery.

### 5. Connect MeshMonitor
Point MeshMonitor to:
- **IP:** `<bridge-host-ip>`
- **Port:** `4403`

Or use mDNS autodiscovery to find the bridge automatically on your network:
```bash
# Test mDNS discovery
avahi-browse -rt _meshtastic._tcp
```

The bridge advertises itself as `_meshtastic._tcp.local.` with TXT records containing:
- `bridge=ble`
- `port=4403`
- `ble_address=<device-mac>`
- `version=1.4.0`

## Documentation

- **Quick Start:** See `QUICK_START.md` for step-by-step setup
- **Deployment:** See `docs/DEPLOY_BLE_BRIDGE.md` for production deployment
- **User Guide:** See `docs/README_BLE_BRIDGE.md` for usage and troubleshooting
- **Technical Details:** See `docs/CLAUDE_BLE_BRIDGE.md` for architecture and development
- **Analysis:** See `docs/BLE_TCP_BRIDGE_ANALYSIS.md` for comprehensive protocol analysis

## Using with Claude Code

This package includes `docs/CLAUDE_BLE_BRIDGE.md` which provides complete context for working on the BLE bridge with Claude Code. Simply:

1. Extract this tarball on your target machine
2. Open the directory in Claude Code
3. Reference `docs/CLAUDE_BLE_BRIDGE.md` for full technical context

## Architecture

```
┌──────────────┐  TCP 4403         ┌───────────────┐
│ MeshMonitor  │ ←────────────────→│  BLE Bridge   │
└──────────────┘                    └───────┬───────┘
      ↑                                     │ BLE
      │ mDNS autodiscovery          ┌───────▼───────┐
      └─────────────────────────────│  Meshtastic   │
                                    └───────────────┘
```

The bridge translates between:
- **BLE:** Raw protobuf bytes on Meshtastic GATT characteristics
- **TCP:** Framed protocol `[0x94][0xC3][LEN][PROTOBUF]`

And provides:
- **mDNS:** Automatic service discovery via Avahi (`_meshtastic._tcp.local.`)

## Docker Compose Integration

For MeshMonitor users, use the included `docker-compose.ble.yml` as an overlay:

```bash
# Copy to MeshMonitor directory
cp docker-compose.ble.yml /path/to/meshmonitor/

# Create .env file
echo "BLE_ADDRESS=AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF" > /path/to/meshmonitor/.env

# Start both services
cd /path/to/meshmonitor
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.ble.yml up -d
```

## Common Issues

### "No BLE adapter found"
```bash
sudo systemctl start bluetooth
```

### "Permission denied"
Container needs `--privileged` flag for BLE access

### "Device not found"
- Ensure device BLE is enabled
- Move closer (BLE range ~10-30m)
- Check device not connected to another app

### "Connection refused" from MeshMonitor
- Verify bridge listening on `0.0.0.0:4403`
- Check firewall allows port 4403
- Test with: `telnet <bridge-ip> 4403`

## Reconnection Behavior (v1.3+)

The bridge now automatically handles node reboots and BLE disconnections:

**Internal Reconnection:**
- Detects disconnections immediately via callback and polling
- Attempts up to 5 reconnections with exponential backoff (2s, 4s, 8s, 16s, 32s)
- Continues operation if reconnection succeeds

**Container Restart:**
- If all reconnection attempts fail, the container exits with error code 1
- Docker's `restart: unless-stopped` policy automatically restarts the container
- Fresh container attempts clean connection to the device

**Recommended Docker Configuration:**
```yaml
services:
  ble-bridge:
    restart: unless-stopped  # Auto-restart on failure
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD-SHELL", "netstat -tln | grep -q :4403 || exit 1"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3
```

**Monitoring:**
Check logs to see reconnection activity:
```bash
docker logs -f ble-bridge
```

Look for:
- `⚠️  BLE device disconnected` - Initial disconnect detected
- `🔄 Reconnection attempt X/5` - Retry in progress
- `✅ Reconnected successfully` - Success
- `💀 Failed to reconnect` - Container will exit and restart
